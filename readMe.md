As someone trapped at home,

I want to find new recipes and cocktails to try,

So that I will not get tired of cooking and drinking the same thing everyday!

With this application on the recipe side, a user will be able to search a desired type of recipe and receive 5 results on the page of recipes that will best match the category searched.

    The recipes will each have a link that the user can click to view the recipe on its original site as well as a picture to get your mouth watering.

    When a user clicks on the picture of a recipe it will enlarge it. The picture can then again be clicked to minimize it and return it to the original position on the page.

With this application a user will be able to click the 'Cocktails!' button and receive 5 random cocktail ideas to try at home along with a picture of each one. These will range from shots to non-alcoholic smoothies to make for fun with all ages.

    When a user clicks on the picture of a cocktail it will enlarge it. The picture can then again be clicked to minimize it and return it to the original position on the page.
